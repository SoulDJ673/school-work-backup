# Llama MVC
This is a codealong exercise where we practiced creating our own DAO.  After successfully creating our DAO, we created a test file.  Testing will be covered next unit.

Our DAO could do the following:
 * Add a llama to llamaHerd
 * List all llamas in llamaHerd
 * List a specific llama in llamaHerd
 * Edit an existing llama
 * Remove a llama from llamaHerd
 
 (Our DAO can CRUD!!)
