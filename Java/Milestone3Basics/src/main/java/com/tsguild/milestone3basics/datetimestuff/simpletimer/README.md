# Simple Timer

This codealong was done as a static class, but I wrote it as a non-static object so I can create as many as I want in any project where it's needed. It just made more sense that way.

#### This timer can:

* Count up by the amount of seconds desired

* Count up by the amount of minutes desired


#### There are three files in this directory:

* README.md - This file

* SimpleTimer.java - The timer

* SimpleTimerRun.java - A simple static class that instantiates a timer and uses it to count.
